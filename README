Example to control Nao with Java qimessaging library and Java compliant wrapper (java-qimessaging-helper)

- Work with Naoqi version 2.x
- Examples that work on Desktop and Android and Robot JVMs

How to:

 - you should add the src folder from java-qimessaging-helper folder to use the helper
 - if you have intellij (http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) you can directly open the projects, that will be proper configure
 - you need to create a class RobotIP in : jnao-example / desktop / HelloDesktop / src / com / aldebaran / demo /
	with those fields :
//Ip for virtual robot
        public static String ip = "127.0.0.1";
//Ip for real robot
//	public static String ip = "192.168.81.164";
//Port for virtual robot
	public static String port = "52977";
//Port for real robot
//	public static String port = "9559";

Java Qimessaing source code could be find here : https://github.com/aldebaran/libqi-java

If you want to test the robot project you must download a JRE on your robots : 
The jre you need is :  Linux x86 jre-8u5-linux-i586.tar.gz

!! Warning !!
On the tools folder of java-qimessaging-helper there is a python script which generate the qimessaging helper library from noaqi APIs, you can update the library with it, but all change I made to fix some mistake in the source will be overidden.
